# CHANGELOG

## v0.3.1
- Updated multiple dependencies.

## v0.3.0
- Refactoring: Now using traits over multiple structs for the `irspt-api` structure.\
  This is a breaking change, but no one uses this program nor its libs, so the versions were
  all regressed to pre-public denote the alpha state and that breaking changes can happen.
- Updated package dependencies.

## v0.2.0
- Added support for multiple template schema versions.\
  This is a breaking change, but because I am not providing a binary and no one uses this program,
  I am not going to provide any migration functionality.
- Multiple other internal refactorings and optimizations.
- Updated multiple dependencies.

## v0.1.0
- Initial release.
